// DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE IN THIS FILE!!!
//
// NOTES:
//
// The Card and Deck classes leverage auto-properties.
// This lets us avoid extra code for properties that would only be
// implemented with the most basic get/set functionality.
// - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties
//
// The ? on some types (e.g., Card? Previous) in Card.cs & Deck.cs
// defines it as "nullable". The type is always actually nullable. The point
// is that we know that, for that specific usage, we expect it to sometimes
// store/return a null reference and we don't want to get warned about it.
// - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/nullable-warnings
// - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types
//
// Similarly, sometimes an assignment or return will result in a warning about
// a "possibly null" reference even if WE know that our logic means that will
// never happen OR we don't care. An ! with the assignment/return tells the compiler
// to be quiet.
//
// For example: "current = current.Next!;" is helpful when we either know Next will
// never be null or we don't care b/c we have logic in place to not dereference
// current later if it is null.
// - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-forgiving
//
// ALL of those warnings are harmless. But if they are bothering you, using the ? and !
// carefully can make them go away (+ the process of analyzing when ? or ! are
// appropriate helps you analyze your code to ensure you're using the references
// correctly).
